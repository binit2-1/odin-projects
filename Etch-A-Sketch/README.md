# Project Etch-A-Sketch

[Live Demo](https://binit2-1.github.io/odin-projects/Etch-A-Sketch/)

## Overview

Etch-A-Sketch is a browser-based drawing application inspired by the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. Users can draw by hovering over a grid of squares, change the grid size, and clear the board to start over. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing Grid:** Draw by hovering your mouse over the grid squares.
- **Customizable Grid Size:** Change the grid size to increase or decrease drawing resolution (e.g., 16x16, 32x32, etc.).
- **Clear Board:** Instantly clear the drawing area to start a new sketch.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Fun UI:** Simple, clean interface with playful styling.

## How to Use

1. **Open the [Live Demo](https://binit2-1.github.io/odin-projects/Etch-A-Sketch/)** in your browser.
2. Use your mouse (or finger on touch devices) to hover over the grid and draw.
3. Use the grid size slider or input to change the number of squares per side.
4. Click the "Clear" button to erase your drawing and reset the grid.
