# Odin Form Project

[Live Demo](https://binit2-1.github.io/odin-projects/form/)

A visually appealing form page inspired by The Odin Project, featuring a centered logo overlay, a scenic background image, and proper photo credits.

## Features

- **Centered Logo Overlay:** Odin logo and text are perfectly centered over a scenic background image.
- **Scenic Background:** Uses a high-quality Unsplash image for visual appeal.
- **Photo Credits:** Credits for the background image are displayed at the bottom of the page.
- **Responsive Layout:** Designed to look good on most desktop screens.
- **Custom Fonts:** Uses the Norse font for the logo and Poppins for credits.
- **Modern Form Validation:** Input borders are grey by default and only turn red when invalid data is entered and the field is not empty or focused.

## How to Use
